# CoolCalculator
Cool physics calculator i did while in highschool, very spaghetti code but overall nice since i was just learning python (arround 2018-2019)
The interface is in spanish
What it does is recieving variables from the user, then considers which variables have been introduced and does the adequate ecuations in order to find the other variables. Works fine with URM and UVRM, free fall is not implemented correctly. 
As I said, code is kinda messy due to the fact that I was not experienced in the language at that time, but I think that I managed the data verification in a correct way
